Readme for VegaStrike version 0.0.9 Alpha
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the release of vegastrike where objects can actually interact instead of flying through each other like ghosts in the wind.
Starships can shoot each other, and more importantly ram into each other.  Turn left by 90 degrees and fly towards some of the hornets.

Smash into a few--go in with guns blazing and watch their shields light up!
The shield effects look state-of-the-art and they  are all accelerated by OpenGL's T&L model! 
Even planets can be hit!

Mail me any comments or suggestions to hellcatv@hotmail.com
I would welcome any changes or additions to shield.bmp that would make the shield look more realistic!   

-----------
 Features:
-----------
-Shields That Glow upon hit (in the location hit)
-BSP Trees that allow one to fly close to a starship, and in the runway of (well formed) models...unlike the victory from WC3. 
-the Normal Force which bounces starships off of each other
-The rings of saturn--a feature oft-missed in previous versions... now added for all to enjoy... just don't fire at 'em ;-)
