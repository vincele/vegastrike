Vega Strike 0.0.3

Welcome to the latest build of Vegastrike!  This isn't a game --yet...
but we have improved many features since 0.0.2

Clicklists are built in... so you can click on ships and it will report so on console (same with selecting)
There is a location selector built in, but with this build you cannot see it
Utilizes SPHERE_MAP in OpenGL to produce fantastic spheremapped ships... shiny+fast
Made it faster on software.... but backgrounds are still textured
Physics works, but is disabled to allow viewing of sphere_map


Key bindings are as follows:
+ forward 
- backwards
Arrow key move
PgUp,PgDown
/,* roll 
q quit

Pan around and view the planets orbiting the glittery sun...see the dozens of ships just sit there :-)....
