Goals for 0.4.2 release:
* MUST TEST:
** Upgrades, especially repair on milspec and known previous troublemakers
** Fix systems to have jump points only outside the "slow-zone"
** Fix a bit of the system generation code: so we can specify everything in the milky_way.xml
** Sparkles (particle system)

* Warp:
** Warp energy use
** no weapons in warp
** Time Compression back for devels

*Jump
** Shields drop when jumping

* Resource management/organization:
** trim redundant thrust animation images

* UI:
** Add cargo pics

* AI:
** Fix AI range trigger happiness
** Fix ITTS to use more iterations of Newton's method


Scripting Goals:
* Flightgroups
** Classification (fleet, squadron, flotilla? etc. - something to differentiate between {5 plowshares} and {3 archimedes, 2 Tesla, 8 kahan, 20 schroedinger, 10 goddard, 5 watson} )
** Flightgroups should have subsets of ships that spawn together (combined arms)

* News
** Fix news to report stories depending on import (fleet lead by dodo=wrong)
	--Is this a problem with news, or the dynamic universe that calls
	  the news?  If story is reported correctly, there's no problem.
	  This means that there is actually a fleet led by a dodo, it's
	  not wrong, just a bad simulation :-) --Dan.a
** Get formatted date back.
