Fix station placement:
In the Cerynea system, the relay station that's orbiting Rocky:Norwich is actually stuck inside it.

A couple more ...

In the Patroclus system, the wormhole to Urania is half inside a planet.
In the Beta Cassiopia system, the medical station is so near the planet that when you try docking at it, you dock at the planet instead. 


Goals for 0.4.3 release:
* MUST TEST:
** Upgrades, especially repair on milspec and known previous troublemakers
** Fix systems to have jump points only outside the "slow-zone"
** Fix a bit of the system generation code: so we can specify everything in the milky_way.xml
** Sparkles (particle system)
** Distance worth worth warping to playability?
** check config value for insys warp_energy divisor (may need to make larger if players running out of juice - numbers not currently playbalanced - will fix balancing later - for now, set to higher value and ignore energy issues
)

*MAKE 0.4.3 Available as a patch.

*Bases
**Add new bases

* Music
**Delete NEWe joke
**put up cosmostation, industrialmixed, space navy, SteelG  for consideration

*Map
**ADD PATCHES!!!

* AI:
** Fix AI range trigger happiness
** Fix ITTS to use more iterations of Newton's method
** Fix SPEC thrashing

*Ships
**Add stats for new ships

*Fix up starting system.

Goals for 'Sometime over the rainbow'
* File loading: 
** Load balance hash-table
** Support full expressivity of BFXM animations
** Fix excessive seeking in File-System
** Install time generation of all BSP files
** Per-System (versus strict per need) ship loading optimization

* Vega Strike universe information:
** Complete Ships list.
** Complete histories.

* UI:
** Add more cargo pics
** Merge BaseComputer modes with NavScreen?
** radio chatter from: to:

* Resource management/organization:
** trim redundant thrust animation images

* Universe consistency
** make pirates... more pirate-like
** grappling hooks?
** Area effect modeling
** Bomb-pumped laser modeling?
** faction standing changes -- sanity?

* Graphical stuff
** make engine lights proportional to accel, not to speed

*AI
** add another dimension to roles (attack AND defend/predator AND prey roles) instead of forcing both to be the same.
** AI spec drive use, escorts...

Scripting Goals:
* Flightgroups
** Classification (fleet, squadron, flotilla? etc. - something to differentiate between {5 plowshares} and {3 archimedes, 2 Tesla, 8 kahan, 20 schroedinger, 10 goddard, 5 watson} )
** Flightgroups should have subsets of ships that spawn together (combined arms)
** make news use new naming scheme
** Fix news to report stories depending on import (fleet lead by dodo=wrong)
	--Is this a problem with news, or the dynamic universe that calls
	  the news?  If story is reported correctly, there's no problem.
	  This means that there is actually a fleet led by a dodo, it's
	  not wrong, just a bad simulation :-) --Dan.a
	  -- By fix, we mean take advantage of the pending changes to script 
	     side that will classify flightgroups in a reasonable way - thus, 
	     if the lead ship is a dodo it shouldn't be a _fleet_

Apparently upgrade system doesn't quite work right and jump drive doesn't quite install right and cargo sometimes grows without bounds...
ECM apparently causes some of these problems
Jump drive goes away after selling it can't buy it back

*Damage
** Fix System Damage so it happens with reasonable frequency

* Cockpit
**Highlight weapons in range in the gun VDU

* News
** Get formatted date back.
