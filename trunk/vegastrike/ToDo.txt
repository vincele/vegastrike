Goals:
*---------------------------------*
Summer
* DATASET BALANCING:
** ------Much work to be done-------
** check config value for insys warp_energy divisor (may need to make larger if players running out of juice - numbers not currently playbalanced - will fix balancing later - for now, set to higher value and ignore energy issues
** Merge in Privateer vegastrike.config
*** make pirates... more pirate-like
*** faction standing changes -- sanity?


*Developer tasks - do profiling to enumerate current performance bottlenecks.
** Changed collision check on revision from 10331 to 10332 to use array instead of r/b tree

*Systems
** Fix station, wormhole, planet placement/generation (avoid too close together - make docking points at stations around/on planet)
** tweak system scales
** tweak system names
** tweak system inhabitations, make more diverse set of planet types
** Docking at planet (test fixed) vs "landing in BFE" on uninhabited world.
** Homeworlds
***Pick hierarchy of interest
** Reduce Jump Points per system

*Damage
** Fix System Damage so it happens with reasonable frequency

*Fix up starting system. Especially wrt Atlantis HUD


*Loci of control
**Speed Limiters
**Auto selection of reference frames
**Enforcement of speed limits

*Factions
**Neutral standing



*Graphics
**New graphics engine (be it ogre or other)
**Decoupling of geometry, materials, textures via indirection.

*Bases
**Fix FOV dependence for 3d models

Future
* Flightgroups
** Classification (fleet, squadron, flotilla? etc. - something to differentiate between {5 plowshares} and {3 archimedes, 2 Tesla, 8 kahan, 20 schroedinger, 10 goddard, 5 watson} )
** Flightgroups should have subsets of ships that spawn together (combined arms)
** make news use new naming scheme
** Organize news to group stories depending on "local" importance

*AI
** add another dimension to roles (attack AND defend/predator AND prey roles) instead of forcing both to be the same.
** AI spec drive use, escorts...
***Check?

*Developer tasks - do profiling to enumerate current performance bottlenecks.

*Release-as-patch-paradigm
** Integrated update system?

* Upgrades
** user-warehouse for intermediate part storage
** selection interface for activating/deactivating parts
** fix displaying of irrelevant stats
** decouple tags and names, more tag types

*Debris Fields


New Developers
* Graphical stuff
** make engine lights proportional to accel, not to speed - done
*Run-time changeable configuration option and key-binding infrastructure
*Remove duplicate tags/ move out of the way of text.

*Map
**More UI improvements always welcome







* Cockpit
**Highlight weapons in range in the gun VDU

* File loading:
** Load balance hash-table
** Support full expressivity of BFXM animations
** Install time generation of all BSP files
** Per-System (versus strict per need) ship loading optimization

* Vega Strike universe information:
** Complete Ships list.
** Complete histories.

* UI:
** Merge BaseComputer modes with NavScreen?
** radio chatter from: to:
** more colors on buy/sell screens



* Resource management/organization:
** trim redundant thrust animation images

* Universe consistency
** Area effect modeling
** Bomb-pumped laser modeling?



*Clydesdale (other capships too? -related to importing of cargo/missions?)

Apparently upgrade system doesn't quite work right and jump drive doesn't quite install right and cargo sometimes grows without bounds...
ECM apparently causes some of these problems
Jump drive goes away after selling it can't buy it back
