Goals for 0.4.2 release:
* MUST TEST:
** Upgrades, especially repair on milspec and known previous troublemakers
** Fix systems to have jump points only outside the "slow-zone"
** Fix a bit of the system generation code: so we can specify everything in the milky_way.xml
** Sparkles (particle system)
** Distance worth worth warping to playability?
** check config value for insys warp_energy divisor (may need to make larger if players running out of juice - numbers not currently playbalanced - will fix balancing later - for now, set to higher value and ignore energy issues
)

*Map
we should make the overall shift-m nav screen A) bigger - make it take up the full screen B) Since it's a HUD artifact, lit independent of scene - having your nav display go all dark, while it shows off the lighting, is... odd
the circles could deal with being, at least on the galaxy view, even a bit smaller
(12:43:37) Jack: there needs to be some way to control which names get printed so as not to clutter the entire screen with overlapping text
(12:44:02) Jack: there should be some color cue that highlights the jumps out of the selected system

*Damage
** Fix System Damage so it happens with reasonable frequency

* AI:
** Fix AI range trigger happiness
** Fix ITTS to use more iterations of Newton's method

Scripting Goals:
* Flightgroups
** Classification (fleet, squadron, flotilla? etc. - something to differentiate between {5 plowshares} and {3 archimedes, 2 Tesla, 8 kahan, 20 schroedinger, 10 goddard, 5 watson} )
** Flightgroups should have subsets of ships that spawn together (combined arms)

* News
** make news use new naming scheme
** Fix news to report stories depending on import (fleet lead by dodo=wrong)
	--Is this a problem with news, or the dynamic universe that calls
	  the news?  If story is reported correctly, there's no problem.
	  This means that there is actually a fleet led by a dodo, it's
	  not wrong, just a bad simulation :-) --Dan.a
	  -- By fix, we mean take advantage of the pending changes to script 
	     side that will classify flightgroups in a reasonable way - thus, 
	     if the lead ship is a dodo it shouldn't be a _fleet_
** Get formatted date back.
