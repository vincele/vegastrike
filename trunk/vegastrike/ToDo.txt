Goals:
* DATASET BALANCING:
** ------Much work to be done-------
** check config value for insys warp_energy divisor (may need to make larger if players running out of juice - numbers not currently playbalanced - will fix balancing later - for now, set to higher value and ignore energy issues
)

*Developer tasks - do profiling to enumerate current performance bottlenecks.

*Run-time changeable configuration option and key-binding infrastructure

*Loci of control

*Release-as-patch-paradigm
** Integrated update system?

*Systems
** Fix station, wormhole, planet placement/generation (avoid too close together - make docking points at stations around/on planet) 
** tweak system scales
** tweak system names
** tweak system inhabitations, make more diverse set of planet types
** Docking at planet vs "landing in BFE" on uninhabited world.
*Fix up starting system.

*Bases
**Fix FOV dependence for 3d models
**Remove duplicate tags/ move out of the way of text.

* Music
**Delete NEWe joke?
**put up cosmostation, industrialmixed, space navy, SteelG  for consideration?

*Map
**More UI improvements always welcome

* Flightgroups
** Classification (fleet, squadron, flotilla? etc. - something to differentiate between {5 plowshares} and {3 archimedes, 2 Tesla, 8 kahan, 20 schroedinger, 10 goddard, 5 watson} )
** Flightgroups should have subsets of ships that spawn together (combined arms)
** make news use new naming scheme
** Organize news to group stories depending on "local" importance 

* Cockpit
**Highlight weapons in range in the gun VDU

* File loading: 
** Load balance hash-table
** Support full expressivity of BFXM animations
** Fix excessive seeking in File-System
** Install time generation of all BSP files
** Per-System (versus strict per need) ship loading optimization

* Vega Strike universe information:
** Complete Ships list.
** Complete histories.

* UI:
** Merge BaseComputer modes with NavScreen?
** radio chatter from: to:
** more colors on buy/sell screens
** HQ font in base screens, even if not in flight


* Upgrades
** user-warehouse for intermediate part storage
** selection interface for activating/deactivating parts
** fix displaying of irrelevant stats
** decouple tags and names, more tag types

* Resource management/organization:
** trim redundant thrust animation images

* Universe consistency
** make pirates... more pirate-like
** Area effect modeling
** Bomb-pumped laser modeling?
** faction standing changes -- sanity?

* Graphical stuff
** make engine lights proportional to accel, not to speed

*AI
** add another dimension to roles (attack AND defend/predator AND prey roles) instead of forcing both to be the same.
** AI spec drive use, escorts...

*Clydesdale (other capships too? -related to importing of cargo/missions?)

Apparently upgrade system doesn't quite work right and jump drive doesn't quite install right and cargo sometimes grows without bounds...
ECM apparently causes some of these problems
Jump drive goes away after selling it can't buy it back

*Damage
** Fix System Damage so it happens with reasonable frequency
