To create a new menu label is easy, just follow these instructions and hope you've got the right fonts and plugins ;-)

First go to the main Gimp window, then go:
	Xtns -> Script-Fu -> Logos -> Alien Glow

Now, to set it up properly:
	--	insert the text you want
	--	set the "Font Size" to 450
	--	choose the font "clean" (bolded at size 16)
	--	set the "Glow Color" so that r=1.00 g=0.89 b=0.21
	--click "OK"

Now set the foreground colour (in the toolbox) to r=0.16 g=0.16 b=0.73 and then click on the "T" icon in the toolbox:
	--	in the options, choose "Use Dynamic Text" and then click in your picture
	--	choose the font "clean" (bolded at size *15*)
	--	Make sure the colour at the top of the dialog is from the foreground
	--	Type exactly the same text that you typed for the previous part
	--	Click "OK"

Now, go to the layers dialog:
	--	Right click on the layer "GDynText Layer" and select "Scale Layer"
	--	Now Scale it by a ratio of "29.7"
	--	Now simply move the layer so that the text lines up properly (until it looks good)

	--	Right click on the layer "GDynText Layer" again, and select "Layer to Imagesize"
	--	Now delete the "background" layer
	--	and then right click on any layer and select "merge Visible Layers"

Now, does your label have any of the letters "g","j","p","q" or "y".........if it does, then resize the image so that it has a height of 26 pixels

if it doesn't, then resize so that the new height is 22 pixels.

Now, open up the menu labels xcf file, and copy your image into it:
	--	once it is pasted, don't press anything, double click on the new layer (in the layers dialog) and rename it to something suitable.
	--	Now you can move it so that it lines up with the other menu items.

Good, now that the menu file is updated, we can make the individual files.  First hide all layers but the backdrop, "glow_on" and your label, and then save this as *n*off.png  now hide the "on glow" and show the "off glow" and save this as *n*on.png (where *n* is the number for the menu)

Almost done, now simply reopen the "on" png file, and right click and goto
		Image -> Colors -> Brightness-Contrast
and then adjust so that
	--	Brightness=44 and Contrast=57

Save and you are done!!!
