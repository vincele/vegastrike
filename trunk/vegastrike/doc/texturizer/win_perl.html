    <font> 3ds2xml script and ActivePerl for Windows 95/98.</font><font><br>
    </font><font> Using a batch file for the 3DS file format.</font><font><br>
    </font><font> by RF Burns</font><font><br>
    </font><font> (RFB147)</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> After hours of trial and error, and a little help from
Dan   A. in the form of a small batch file provided by Jason W., I was able
to  import a new ship from converting a 3DS model file into the required
XMESH  and XUNIT files needed for Vega Strike by combining both the batch
file and  3ds2xml script.</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> Here are the steps to convert your model file into a 3DS
 file  and run it through the 3ds2xml script in the Windows 9x OS, using
ActivePerl   for Windows 9x.</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> Grab a copy of Active State ActivePerl for Windows 9x from
  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/. Follow the instructions
 to install Perl onto your computer. (NOTE! This program may or may not modify
  the autoexec.bat file of the system, therefore, if it does not add Perl
to  the path, you must add the path into the autoexec.bat file then reboot
the  system!) This program will create a bunch of new folders under a folder
you  choose to install the program into, normal default is c:\program files\perl.
  The only folder we will be concerned with for the conversion process will
  be the \bin folder for placing a couple more files later. After installing
  Perl, proceed to grab a copy of a good file converter if your model file
 is not in the 3DS format.</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> Such a converter can be found at http://www.stmuc.com/thbaier/index.html...or 
 you can view the <a href="howto.htm#bookmarks">bookmarks</a> on the main
howto page.</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> After installing both the ActivePerl and a 3D file format 
 coverter, run your model file through your 3D file format converter to generate 
 a 3DS file of your original source file. 3DS!!! This is very important!! 
3DS!!!</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font><i> Note for new 3D modelers</i></font><font><i>:</i></font><font><i><br>
    </i></font><font><i> For those new to this 3D model stuff like me, if 
you  are working with a DXF source file, it is important to set the RGB color
 settings to some number so that your model does not appear negative, or
hollow  in both the texturizer AND the game!! (one of those trial and error
things!  ;) ) Make shure the RGB is set to some number like 35 for R, 45
for G, and  60 for B, and save it BEFORE you convert to the 3DS format. The
numbers I  used here are just for example, you can use whatever number for
each color  you wish other than zero. The lower the number, the darker the
model will  be. If this is not done, your model will appear hollow and negative,
and cause the texturizer tool to crash when trying to add logos or guns!!!
(Thanks to Mario HC1 Brito for the RGB setting tip! :) )</i></font><font><i><br>
    </i></font> <font><br>
    </font><font> After conversion of your model into the 3DS file format,
 you  can proceed to the next step in getting your ship into Vega Strike!</font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font><font> For those of you who like things handed on a platter,&nbsp;</font><font><a
 href="3ds2xml.bat">  here</a> </font><font>  is the batch file with the 
3ds2xml script inserted to convert 3DS files into the XMESH and XUNIT file 
 formats. &nbsp;<i>Note that this bat file is not tested and may not work.</i></font><font><br>
    </font> <font><br>
    </font> <font><b>Here are the headers and footers for the perl script 
to  behave itself correctly:</b></font><font><br>
    </font> <br>
        <br>
 @rem = '--*-Perl-*--<br>
 @echo  off<br>
 if "%OS%" == "Windows_NT" goto WinNT<br>
 perl -x -S "%0" %1 %2 %3  %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9<br>
 goto endofperl<br>
 :WinNT<br>
 perl -x -S %0  %*<br>
 if NOT "%COMSPEC%" == "%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe" goto  endofperl<br>
 if %errorlevel% == 9009 echo You do not have Perl in your  PATH.<br>
 if errorlevel 1 goto script_failed_so_exit_with_non_zero_val  2&gt;nul<br>
 goto endofperl<br>
 @rem ';<br>
 <br>
 INSERT THE  SCRIPT HERE<br>
 <br>
 __END__<br>
 :endofperl<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;<font> If you would like (or have) to do things for yourself, or want 
to try  with another perl converter (namely the objtoxml one), then copy the
above  text into notepad, and paste the contents of your selected script
 (ie 3dstoxml)  script over the line containing "</font>INSERT THE  SCRIPT 
HERE<font>".&nbsp; Save and name this new file (w/o quotes) "whatever.bat".
 Place the batch  file into the perl\bin folder. Also, copy your 3DS model
 file into the perl\bin  folder. Then, all you have to do is drag your model
 file over the batch file  and it will compile. NOTE! It is important to
have  the batch file AND your  3DS model file in the perl\bin folder!!! Pay
close  attention to the Perl console as it compiles for any error messages.</font><font><br>
    </font><font> Once conversion is completed, and depending on the size 
and  complexity of your model, you will have one or more XUNIT files and one
or  more XMESH files within the perl\bin folder.</font><font><br>
    </font><font> If you have textured your model prior to 3DS conversion,
 everything  should be fine unless the converter did not properly convert
the textures.  If not, now is the time to read up on the texturizer and use
that to give  your ship its looks. Guns and logo placements can also be added
by using the texturizer.</font><font><br>
    </font><font> After making your ship appear as you would like, and loaded
  up as you like, follow the instructions on ship importing in the tutorials
  to fly your ship! :)</font><font><br>

 A huge round of applause for the entire Vega Strike team for  producing
an excellent space sim! I can't stop playing it!</font><br>
