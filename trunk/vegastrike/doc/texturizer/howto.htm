  <title>How to make a starship for Vegastrike</title>
</head>
  <body bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
 
<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
 
<p>This HOWTO will go through the basics of creating a model (starfighter 
or otherwise) and then playing as it or against it in vegastrike. </p>
 
<p><i>Note: This HOWTO is a work in progress, chances are there are going 
to be a lot of missing or wrong bits. If anyone can spot an error, or would 
like something included, let someone know.</i></p>
 
<p>If anyone would like to change/improve this, feel free to do so.....so 
long as you send any modifications to <a
 href="MAILTO:dandandaman@users.sourceforge.net" target="_top">  me.</a> </p>
 
<p>To get started you are going to need several things.</p>
 
<p>1. A copy of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vegastrike"
 target="_top">  Vegastrike</a> </p>
 
<p>2. A 3D <a href="#modellers">modelling program</a>   that ouputs 3DS or
OBJ files, or a <a href="#converters">converter</a>   that does the same.</p>
 
<p>3. Access to a <a href="#perl">'perl' enabled computer</a> </p>
 
<p>4. An <a
 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/vegastrike/vegastrike/objconv/"
 target="_top">  xml converter script</a> </p>
 
<p>Optional 5. A copy of<font size="3"><a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vegastrike" target="_top"> Texturiser</a>
 </font></p>
 
<p><font size="3"><i>Note: It is not necessary to get the cvs version of Vegastrike,
the tarball should work fine. Texturiser however has had a few new features
added since the last "pre-release", and some of these will be referred to
in this howto. So if you plan to use texturiser with your modelling, it is
recommended --but not nescesary-- that you get the cvs version.</i></font></p>
 
<p><b><u>Doing it</u></b><i> -"I've got everything, where do I go from here"</i></p>
 
<ul>
   <li>Modelling (General)</li>
 
</ul>
 <font>If you are new to modelling, then you will need to learn to use your 
chosen program first. In my opinion, <a href="#tutorials">tutorials</a> 
 are the best way to do this. The selection in this howto is very limited
 and was not the result of a specific search. If no tutorials can be found
 in the program, or on your programs website, use a general search engine
to look -there will almost certainly be some lurking around somewhere. </font>
 
<ul>
 Once you have a basic understanding of how your program works, you are ready 
to begin creating. There are several key things you must think about before 
creating a ship for vegastrike. First of all, you need to be able to export 
into either the 3DS or OBJ file types. If your program cannot do this, get
a converter that can.  
</ul>
 
<ul>
 Secondly, you are making a ship for a game, so there are going to be many 
ships being rendered at any one time --this means you are going to have to 
try to keep a low polygon count (1-400 maximum for a fighter craft, and nothing 
more than 1000 for the <b><i>very</i></b> largest). This is assuming you are
prepared to make multiple LODs (Level Of Detail meshes) for your craft, if
you are not going to, the polygon count should be much smaller. I will get
into that later.  
</ul>
 
<ul>
 Only use the size texture file that you need, there is no sense having a 
huge texture file for your ship when you only use a few parts of it --be economical!
If your program or filetype converter doesn't export UV co-ordinates (specifying
where polygons get their texture), then you are going to have to use <i>texturiser</i>
 for texuturing. This means you will have to texture every polygon seperately......
a lot of work for the bigger craft.<br>
  <br>
  <i>IMPORTANT: &nbsp;from versions 0.2.2 and later of Vegastrike. textures
must have sizes that are powers of two (ie 64, 128, 256 etc) or else the
game will crash upon loading the texture.</i><br>
  
</ul>
 
<ul>
 That's all you really need to know at this stage, if it seems harder than 
you thought to make a decent looking ship, it's because it is. But with some 
imagination and determination, you should get the results you want. 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Converting (Getting to a VS supported file type)</li>
 
</ul>
 <font>If your chosen program can output into of the supported file types, 
then there is no need for you to read this stage. If not though, then you 
need a converter that is able to convert your spaceship file into a supported 
file. Simply follow the converters instructions to export your model. If you
do not want to have to retexture the whole craft again (assuming you did
it already), then you should make sure that your converter can convert  UV
coordinates. If it doesn't and you can't find one that does  (<a
 href="http://www.anim8or.com/" target="_top">Anim8or </a> <i>should</i>
do it), don't despair. All it means is that you are going to  have to retexture
you craft (and if you have any, its LODs) using texturiser.</font> 
<ul>
   <font><a name="perl"></a>   </font>   <li>Converting (Getting to xml)</li>
 
</ul>
 
<p align="center"><i>Note: If you are running linux, then you should have 
perl already installed (or at least on your distribution CDs).  If you are 
using windows, you most likely do not have it -so follow the instructions 
</i><font size="3"><i><a
 href="file:///home/daniel/vegastrike/web_page/howto/win_perl.html">here</a>
.</i></font></p>
 
<p align="center"><u>Linux</u>: Once perl is installed it is all very easy. 
 The converters are perl scripts, so simply apply the script to a file..... 
</p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3"><i>Eg using bash: ./3ds2xml epeellcat.3ds</i></font></p>
 
<p align="center"><u>Windows</u>: In windows it is a bit harder but still
workable. </p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3"><i>For windows: Read the mini-howto&nbsp;<a
 href="win_perl.html">here</a>.</i></font></p>
 
<p>If all went well, the script should have run without a hitch and you should 
now have one or more *.xmesh files (with the UV coordinates intact) and two 
*.xunit files. If not, then either you, or one of your programs, stuffed up.
Occasionally, the output file from your program may not work (although you
know it to be completely valid), in this case, try exporting again from another
program. </p>
 
<p>You can safely delete all but one xunit file, and then rename it to what 
your ship is called (while lopping off the xunit extension). Now, open up 
the unit file, and make sure that it is pointing to the right xmesh file/s. 
</p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3">For a single mesh file: &lt;Meshfile file="epeellcat.xmesh"/&gt;</font></p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3">For multiple mesh files:</font></p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3">&lt;Meshfile file="epeellcat1.xmesh"/&gt;</font></p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3">&lt;Meshfile file="epeellcat2.xmesh"/&gt;</font></p>
 
<p align="center"><font size="3">&lt;Meshfile file="epeellcat3.xmesh"/&gt;</font></p>
 
<p>And then open up the xmesh file, to make sure it's pointing to the right 
texture file. </p>
 
<p>Congratulations, your basic ship designing is done (unless you need to 
<a href="texturing.html" target="_top">texture</a>   using texturiser). Now
it is time to change your ship from an empty shell  to a fully fledged ship,
using the xmesh and unit files. Texturiser is good  to be used when adding
weapons, but is not nescesary.  Other options are available for your model
other than a simple texture.  The options and how to use them are found in
the <a href="#xmesh">xmesh</a>   section of this howto.</p>
 
<p><b><u>Texturiser</u></b><i> -Preparing to texture</i></p>
 
<p>The texturiser is an utility for adding weapons and engines etc to a ship, 
as well as changing the uv mapping of a texture on a mesh. In the editor (because
it's an old branch of vegastrike) confed stars and blue turret-like things
are used to place weapons etc.</p>
 
<p>You texture the unit titled texture.xunit .You rename the .xunit file of
the spaceship you wish to texture as "texture.xunit". If there is no texture 
on the .xmesh file you can specify it either by writing it in texture.txt, 
or by editing the first line of the .xmesh file so that the first line reads 
</p>
 
<p>&lt;Mesh texture="xxxxx"&gt; </p>
 
<p>Where xxxxx is the name of the texture file ie epeellcat.png. The file
types that are currently supported are bmp and png.  Although it is prefered,
if your ship is going to be submitted, that it be in the png filetype (and
compressed as much as possible).</p>
 
<p>Ok now it is time to run the program. To get a feel for this, it is recommended 
that you follow the walkthrough, which will take you through the process of
<a href="texturing.html">texturing</a>   and adding <a
 href="weapons.html" target="_top">weapons</a>  .  You can also refer to
the <a href="controls.html" target="_top">controls</a>   page for a printable
list of all texturiser commands.</p>
 
<p><font><a name="xmesh"></a> </font><b><u>The xmesh file</u></b><i> -Pretty
decorations and such...</i></p>
 
<p>The options in the xmesh file are pretty much straight forward.  The top 
line as you would notice starts with &lt;Mesh texture="yourtexture.png"&gt;.
  There are other options available though, these are scale, animation, blendmode
 and alphamap. </p>
 
<p align="center"><u>Using BMP files:</u></p>
 
<p><u>Scale:</u><i>0.5 is half scale, 1.0 is normal etc</i></p>
 
<p><u>Animation:</u><i>Allows texture animations.  eg </i>animation="test.ani"<i>
   The is a plain text file using the following format:</i></p>
 
<p>numframes numsecondsperframe </p>
 
<p>frame1.bmp frame1.alp </p>
 
<p>frame2.bmp frame2.alp </p>
 
<p><i>The alp files are optional 256 colour greyscale files specifying the 
transparency.  White is solid, and black is transparent.</i></p>
 
<p><u>Blendmode:</u><i>This is the transparency of the mesh.  If it is set 
to "ONE ZERO" then the mesh will be solid.  If it is "ONE ONE" then it will 
be 50% transparent.  If it is set to "SRCALPHA INVSRCALPHA" then it will use
the alphamap file to set the transparency.</i></p>
 
<p><u>Alphamap:</u><i>This is the map to be used to set the transparency with
blendmode="SRCALPHA INVSRCALPHA".  It should be in the same format as the
alp files (256 colour greyscale) and is used in the same way, with white solid,
and black transparent.</i></p>
 
<p align="center"><u>Using PNG files:</u></p>
 
<p align="center">Sorry, not yet :-( </p>
 
<p>You can also add some other options at the bottom of the file:  </p>
 
<p>&lt;/Polygons&gt; </p>
 
<p>&lt;material reflect="0"&gt; </p>
 
<p>&lt;specular red="0" green="0" blue="0" alpha="0"/&gt;  </p>
 
<p>&lt;ambient red="1" green="1" blue="1" alpha="1"/&gt;  </p>
 
<p>&lt;diffuse red="1" green="1" blue="1" alpha="1"/&gt;  </p>
 
<p>&lt;/material&gt; </p>
 
<p>&lt;/mesh&gt; </p>
 
<p>These are all pretty self explanatory, but if you don't get it, feel free 
to ask. </p>
 
<p><a name="unit"></a> <b><u>The unit file</u></b><i> -Give your ship some
guts!</i></p>
 
<p>The unit file is the file that defines what your spaceship can do. It is
here that you can adjust its mass, speed, engines and most important of all......
weapons. Self explanatory items (of my judging) will not be covered.  It
is probably best to look at some of the unit files of the vegastrike ships,
and then fiddle with the values not covered here until you get a result you
are happy with.</p>
 
<p>Mounts have sizes, specifying which types of weapons they could hold should 
that ordinance be available. The sizes available are: </p>
 
<p align="center">"light," "medium," "heavy," "capship-light," "capship-heavy" 
and "special" </p>
 
<p>and for missiles: </p>
 
<p align="center">"light-missile," "medium-missile," "heavy-missile," "light-capship-missile," 
"heavy-capship-missile," "special-missile"</p>
 
<p>The mount can be any of these types, or if nothing is specified, the weapon 
will be fixed.</p>
 
<p>Now that mount size is specified, you can choose the weapon type.  The 
names of all current weapons available to be specified is located in weapon-info.xml. 
 If you want to, you are welcome to create your own weapons for inclusion. 
 An example is: </p>
 
<p><i>&lt;Mount weapon="Laser" size="Light" x="1.600000" y="-1.200000" z="14.000000" 
ri="0.762493" rj="0.457496" rk="0.457496" qi="-0.432829" qj="0.886268" qk="-0.164887"/&gt;</i></p>
 
<p>Turrets are similar, and can have a file specified from where to load the
turret unit (and meshes). </p>
 
<p><i>eg  &lt;Subunit file="turret" x="-37.414394" y="13.548389" z="204.285370" 
ri="0.762493" rj="0.457496" rk="0.457496" qi="-0.432829" qj="0.886268" qk="-0.164887"/&gt; 
</i></p>
 
<p><i>In both of these cases, ri,rj,rk and qi,qj,qk are the orientation of 
the weapon.  They appear when texturizer is used to place the gun/turret and
point out perpendicular from the polygon it was placed on.  Delete them to
make the weapon face forward, or leave rk="-1" to make it face backwards.</i></p>
 
<p>Lights can have both color and a texture specified. </p>
 
<p><i>eg  &lt;Light file="texturefile.png" x="0" y="0" z="-66" size="50" r="0.898039"
g="0.803922" b="0.070588"/&gt;  </i></p>
 
<p><i>Here, r,g,b is the colour of the light (each ranging from 0 to 1).</i></p>
 
<p>Cockpits can have the file specified and the position of the cockpit. </p>
 
<p><i>eg &lt;Cockpit file="bomber-cockpit.cpt</i><i>" x="10" y="10" z="100"/&gt;</i></p>
 
<p><b><u>Playing against or as your ship</u></b></p>
 
<p>Well, this is the easy part.  Create a folder in the units subdir with 
its name being your ships name.  Now move the mesh, unit file and texture 
into it (the texture could also be place in the textures directory).  Make 
sure that the unit file's name is the same as the folder's name and then
we are done.  Now simply open up the mission file you intend playing.  You
are positioned in the first flightgroup.  Change the type of craft to your
new one and off you go.  If you want to play against your ship, then simply
change any other flightgroup to use your ship. </p>
 
<p><i>Tip:  If you find your ships blowing up before you can do anything, 
they may be too big for the current spacing........resize them in the xmesh 
file or move them away from other craft!</i></p>

<p>If you are willing to spend some money to start modelling, we recommend 
purchasing AC3D -as it also runs on linux!  However, most of you probably 
will just want to have a little muck around, in which case Anim8or is your 
best substitute (although at the moment only available for windows).  Take 
note though that both are nowhere near as feature rich as the more expensive 
modellers and doing something may be a little harder than you thought. </p>

<p>The recommended programs are purely a personal choice from what some of 
us found easiest to use several months ago.  If you find a program just as 
useable, let us know.  Also, if you find a program/converter/tutorial not 
included on this list that can compete with the ones included, let us know 
about it.  If it is a modelling program, then also give us your own rating 
compared to our recommended ones.</p>
