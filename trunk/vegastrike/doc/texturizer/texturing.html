<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To cycle between the different meshes in a unit, merely hit 0 or 9.  This will change the displayed texture map and selected mesh. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The example included is a very small star ship called the hornet. It is already textured, but to learn the ropes, we will need to start fresh. Press k to clear the ship completely. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now you're left with a green ship... and a lot of free time... so lets go!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">First press the &quot;down&quot; arrow key (on the arrow pad), the hornet will miraculously rotate up so you can see the top half. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Find the mouse at the top left of the screen, now click somewhere in the lower right section of the texture... yep the right triangle changes. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You didn't REALLY want to do that, did you? </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Press the right mouse button to &quot;undo&quot; what you just did. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Look at any triangle shape on the texture, maybe a big white one. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Click on one of the corners of the triangle. The texture should alter slightly. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Press the &quot;*&quot; key on the NUMBER PAD to go to the next vertex. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Proceed in a clockwise direction around the texture by clicking on another corner then pressing &quot;*&quot; again to get to the third vertex. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Click the point for the third vertex and watch the texture 'snap' into place. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If it looks really distorted, don't worry. We can rotate the texture. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Press the &quot;y&quot; or &quot;u&quot; keys to rotate it (y rotates clockwise, u rotates counterclockwise).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">until you are happy with the way it looks. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you like you can press the &quot;r&quot; key to reverse it and then the y and u keys to manipulate it. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One face down, a whole ship to go! </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hit the &quot;/&quot; key twice to cycle back to the starting vertex. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can now copy the triangle from here (copying always starts at the current vertex you are pointing at). </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Hit &quot;c&quot; to copy.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Press the &quot;+&quot; key to get on to the next triangle, then press &quot;v&quot; to paste the triangle and &quot;r&quot; to reverse it (to get a mirror image). </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Viola!... you have a symmetrical ship! </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Press the &quot;+&quot; key again. This polygon is under the wing and is vertical.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Manipulate the ship with the arrow keys on the arrow pad until you have a view of it.  Press plus again, and then press it again. These polygons are insignificant and can be skipped.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now we come to the bottom of the ship. Manipulate so you see the belly then pick another white triangle to texture on the bottom.  Left click and use the * to go to the next vertex. If you make a mistake just hit the right mouse button to undo.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now this big texture blocking your ship may start to annoy you.  You can easily adjust the transparency with the F9 and F10 keys.  Make it as clear/opaque as you wish.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">OK, now that you've worked so hard, press x to save the file (you don't want the program to crash and lose everything do you?). </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now it is time to start on the quadrilaterals of the ship as all of the triangles have been textured. Press the &quot;m&quot; key to get to quadrilaterals (m and n cycle through poly types) or F1-F9 to access any of the nine poly types... Flip the ship so you can see the cockpit.  Time to texture that. Using what you've done so far, have a go on your own. </FONT> 
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">'C' copies a polygon and 'V' pastes it onto another place.</FONT>  <FONT FACE="Arial">Texture the cockpit and paste it into other areas of the ship by using the +/- keys to travel around the different polygons.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">I think that's about all you will need to know to get going.  A complete list of the controls can be found <A HREF="controls.html" TARGET="_top">here</A>.  Good luck!</FONT>
