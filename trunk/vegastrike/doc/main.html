        <li> Well As most of you have realized, yesterday was indeed the
first, or as some like to know it... the day of the April Fools. I would
like to thank those april fools ( you know who you are ) for participating
and sending me pleas to be part of the beta. However, don't take that to
mean that multiplayer is defunct... read on! </li>
        <li> Let me clear up some misconceptions...as well as some conceptions 
        </li>
        <li> <b>The good news:</b> Features that will be in Vegastrike-0.2.2 
        </li>
        <li> Check out the new <a href="http://420.cstj.net/%7EE9857944/vs/index.html" target="_blank">
Starship Guide</a>
 for vegastrike thanks to the excellent Marcel Par&eacute;, who has contributed
numerous starships for the 0.2.2 release.  </li>
        <li> <u>Multiplayer is indeed</u> in the vegastrike development tree.
Since I was very small I have always longed for the split-screen version
of multiplayer the most, and only one game of mine had it: Wing Commander
Armada. That way I could play games with friends even though we had only
one computer.  Finally I am bringing a new splitscreen version of Vegastrike.
You and your friends can <a href="pics/turretpilot.jpg">cooperate</a>
 by flying each others <a href="pics/turretpilot2.jpg">turrets</a>
 or working together to complete a mission.  Or you can <a href="pics/headtohead.jpg">
Attack</a>
 each other, sparring for <a href="pics/headtohead2.jpg">superiority</a>
.  </li>
        <li> I've added trading modes, and you can accept missions from within
bases. </li>
        <li> Cargo prices fluctuate as other privateers trade in their goods. 
        </li>
        <li> You can use money from cargo to purchase new weapons for your
ship or even a brand new, off-the-shelf brand from any of your favorite ship
dealers. </li>
        <li> Cargo missions have players run contraband through areas (don't
get searched) and have players escort cargo ships to their destinations. </li>
        <li> Bounty hunters will be gleeful at the bounty missions that require
the player to hunt down a well armed foe...for a price. </li>
        <li> Damages causes systems to short out and consoles to burst. Weapons
blow off and any of your systems can fail at any time. Don't let this discourage
you: you can always buy a repair bot! </li>
        <li> Communications are supported: they let you insult a foe or carry
on a winding conversation with a friend.  Just don't let your tounge go off
or you may have more than one enemy. </li>
        <li> Both video and auditory communications are supported. Unfortunately
we have no voice actors nor anything for potential voice actors to say. If
you think you can help script some conversations please mail us (see link
below). </li>
        <li> <b>The bad news</b> </li>
        <li> Neither TCP/IP nor IPX will be supported until some Networking
programmers join our team. (that will be the day) If you are an enthusiastic
networking programmer that is willing to learn new code, we urge you to join
our team. </li>
        <li> The release has also been delayed due to lack of basic datafiles
such as cargo and contraband lists. If you think you can help out with prices
and types of purchasable cargo and possible weapons upgrades, please <a href="vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net">
contact us</a>
, and I can help you get started. </li>

        <li> Hello Everyone. I would like to announce a massively multiplayer
Vegastrike due out shortly.  You will be able to explore a realm of space,
accept missions for pay, run contraband through heavily guarded space, and
have complex dialogs with opponents.  However, due to the sensitivity of
testing a massively multiplayer beta, we require the following. If you wish
to participate in the beta, please <a href="mailto:vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net">
e-mail us</a>
 before 11:59 pm today with at least 2 helpful comments about your experience
with Vegastrike 0.2.1 to show your enthusiasm. Any entrants with two meaninful
comments before 11:59 (pacific daylight time) today will be accepted into
the beta test, and all others will be considered more carefully (based on
the participation rate) </li>
        <li> Thank you for your consistent support for vegastrike.  </li>

        <li> Progress has been made on nebulae! Matthew Kruer <a href="pics/nebulafeathered1.jpg">
   feathered</a>
    the edge of a <a href="pics/nebulafeathered2.jpg">nebula</a>
   , and I made it not oversaturate! </li>
                       
        <li> Additionally I made a <a href="pics/roidoutsidebig.jpg">target 
 cam</a>
    that can view targets and objects in your VDU! </li>
                       
        <li> Well What do you know...that camera shows <a href="pics/roids.jpg">
   Asteroids</a>
   ! I've developed a new system to precompute collisions between asteroids 
 and players, and have displayed and collided against over <a href="pics/roids4.jpg">
   5,920</a>
    individual <a href="pics/roids3.jpg">asteroids</a>
    at 40 fps! </li>
                       
        <li> I made an asteroid generator that lets any artist generate 
a perfect asteroid field at any resolution and level of detail...from TNT 
 to GeForce3! </li>
                       
        <li> Check out the <a href="pics.html">Screenshots page</a>
    for more good shots! </li>
                       
        <li> So good times are about to arrive for vegastrike.  The release 
 can be expected _before_ good old V-Day, so get your flowers ready (*for 
me*) hehehe..I deserve them, as does the rest of the vegastrike team!!! </li>

        <li> The 0.2.0 release executable has been finalized. No known bugs
exist and it has all features I planned for 0.2.0  . Like 0.1.0 you can expect
this release to be a big, well thought out one with a GUI installer even.
 Unfortunately I need artists and mission-designers to help me design missions
and get this release out!  please <a href="mailto:vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net">
   Contact</a>
    me if you wish to help make this release happen soon by contributing
missions  and star systems! </li>
                       
        <li> I have completed nebulas in vegastrike! Now you can explore 
systems that have nebulas in certain regions of space! </li>
                       
        <li> DMJC, has contributed an excellent <a href="pics/foggyoutsideneb.jpg">
   nebula model</a>
   . </li>
                       
        <li> I have added fogging when <a href="pics/foggy.jpg">inside</a>
    the nebula.  Watch your spaceship <a href="pics/foggyneb.jpg">fade </a>
   out! </li>
                       
        <li> The nebula scrambles your radar and screws with your targetting 
 equipment. </li>
                       
        <li> Also it reduces shield regeneration (or completely turns off 
 your shields if you set that option in vegastrike.config) </li>
                       
        <li> Combat within a nebula is hair raising and difficult... not 
only can you not see your target in radar, but your enemy can sneak out of
 the gassy clouds and suddenly blow you out of the water^H^H^H^H^Hgas!

        <li> I made the jump animation slowly close upon the jumping starship 
 so that it reaches it in time 'd' where d is the delay in the specific jump 
 drive! </li>
                       
        <li> DMJC, has contributed the perfect jump animation!.  It looks 
 so awesome when the starships pass through the jump gates! It's a very unique 
 style of jump gate, and it matches what I imagined to the nth degree ;-)
           </li>
                       
        <li> Watch as I line up with a <a href="pics/jumping.jpg">jump</a>

        <li> I have spent the past 3 days working on an intense multi-system 
 engine. </li>
                       
        <li> Now any number of systems can be simulated in parallel with 
teh one you are in. </li>
                       
        <li> So naturally I had to make warp gates between the parallel 
systems.  They are small blue transparent balls, and when you get inside and
activate your stardrive, you can immediately teleport to the connected star
system. </li>
                       
        <li> However, do not feel so safe once you have jumped.  If the 
enemy has a jump drive, he/she will pursue you to your death :-) </li>
                       
        <li> I am in need or a nice jump animation to put int for the jumping 
 effect. </li>
                       
        <li> DMJC, darkmage, the head of the WCU page has figured out how 
 to compile vegastrike! This means that we may see many more releases coming 
 up. I'm always too swamped to reboot to windows, and I'm not even sure ALex 
 has windows. It's great to have another helper on board who can churn out 
 some windows binaries for all the loyal Gates sla... I mean Windows People 
 out there :-) </li>
                       
        <li> Expect a release relatively shortly with all these new features!

      <ul>
                       
        <li> Work on Vegastrike has been marching forward.  Alex has made 
 major progress on a mission scripting system so powerful that it can be used
 to write entire AI modules and make starships warp in, etc all in one package.
  It should be relatively simple for veteran C programmers to adapt to this
 system of scripting. </li>
                       
        <li> I have rewritten the collision system to use <a href="http://crystal.sourceforge.net">
   crystal space</a>
   's RAPID collision system.  Instead of seeing if the mesh is inside, it
 only checks against the skin of the starship. This means it checks against
 each and every polygon of each mesh, making for very accuract capship to
capship or fighter to fighter collisions.  The most beautiful thing is that
when crystal space modifies its collision system, I can update my own with
their source since I copied their GPL-licensed code directly instead of forking 
 and making vegastrike compatible.  The code is a little longer, but it's 
just as fast. </li>
                       
        <li> I have completely redone planets so that the terrain stays 
flush with the planet surface.  It's amazing to fly across the planet and 
 see the sunrise on the land!  It was challenging to get vehicles to drive 
 on this terrain, and I believe that currently vehicles are rather hacked 
into the system--but at least they work. </li>
                       
        <li> I have added some fog spheres so that in certain areas fog 
is triggered.  </li>
                       
        <li> Daniel Aleksandrow has worked on adding some nice backgrounds
            </li>
                       
        <li> A wonderful mesh was added by f109avampire (named for him). 
It also helped me track down a number of explosion-related bugs that are now
purged :-). </li>
                       
        <li> Reliant has put together a really cool ship builder that will 
 let future privateers build their own starships out of the component pieces. 
 Go Reliant! </li>
                       
        <li> Png support has been added so that vegastrike accepts png as
well as bitmap files.  They load up about three times as fast as the .bmps.
            </li>
                       
        <li> Time compression has been added to let users speed up or decrease 
 the time (for autopilot-like maneuvers) </li>
                       
        <li> Rotation has been added for orbital objects around their own 
 axis...right now it's global...but soon it will be on a per-planet basis
           </li>
                       
        <li> A text output display has been hacked in by Alex...and an elite
style radar also has been added to the cockpit displays. </li>
                       
        <li> A starbase has been added by James Carthew for collision testing 
 among other things. It looks really cool.   </li>

edit sol.system and change continuous terrain's mass="100" instead of ".0000001" 
 that will havea  more releastic mass...but I figure most of you want to just
 fly around and don't want to die on crash </li>

 2000 machines (perhaps without updates?) I have included a question in the 
 install program that asks if you wish to have sound.  If you are having trouble
 with vegastrike randomly quitting, try saying "no" to sound and seeing if
 it works </li>

 Vegastrike will have high quality, free weapon sounds! </li>

   Sign up for the mailing list</a>
    and send me your ideas and suggestions for the beta release due by the
 end of this week! </li>
                       
        <li> And throughout the week, the renowned Somall has created from 
 scratch a wonderful shield damage and weapon damage sound as well as a laser 
 sound that brings back memories of old!    </li>
                       
        <li> In addition he has some cool flyby sounds he's sent a bunch 
of nice afterburner, explosion, and missile sounds! Thank you so much Major 
 &amp; Somall! You have made the imminent Vegastrike beta possible! </li>
                       
        <li> Also Tobias Wollgarn has sent me a couple of very nice engine 
 and explosion sounds! You can expect to be hearing them soon as well! </li>
                       
        <li> You can expect the beta most likely by Friday if my art goes 
 well!  I need to still make some nice Beam textures... If any artists think 
 they can make a few bolt and beam and weapon animations or stillframe textures, 
 please contact me to help out at <a href="mailto:hellcatv@hotmail.com">hellcatv@hotmail.com</a>
            </li>
                       
        <li> And, Last by very certainly not least, Daniel Aleksandrow has
made a number of beautiful LODs that one an hardly tell (at a distance) are
not the original models!  He's been working on a <a href="help.html">  Vegastrike
Model HOWTO</a>
    detailing how a 3d modeller can make starships for vegastrike! Read it
 and see if you can help out too! </li>

 by...viewers like you! </li>
                       
        <li> Note to linux users:  I have been trying to track down a bug 
 related to drawing lines with MESA_FX... Apparently the bug is not my own, 
 but when I call glEnable (TEXTURE0) in Mesa 3.x it segfaults upon calling 
 a null function. If you're getting strange errors in Mesa with a Voodoo1 
or 2 card, the fix is: Upgrade to Mesa 4.0 (just released)... make sure to 
compile with glide and put your glide libs in the strange dirs recommended 
by the docs! </li>

        <li> A Windows version now compiles and works properly. OpenAL uses
DirectSound3D for sound support, making Vegastrike hardware accelerated with
respect to sound in Windows </li>
                       
        <li> I rewrote the sound library in vegastrike to comply with some 
 of DirectSound's limitations </li>
                       
        <li> I added the doppler effect to work with sounds and added configuration 
 to the configuration file for "how much" doppler should be applied to moving 
 sounds </li>
                       
        <li> I still need various weapons sounds (laser bolts, mass weapons, 
 disruptor beams, shield hit sounds (electric) and hull and armor hit and 
damage sounds for a release, but nothing else is barring this release) </li>
                       
        <li> I got a nice GeForce 3 card today! Maybe this means we'll be
seeing some vertex programs in the future (imagine cloaking distorting the
mesh like in the movies!)  I'll have to fiddle with it a lot though!

        <li> I have completed turrets! Starships may be built with turrets 
 on them. Turrets may be restricted to a cone, half-sphere, or inverse cone 
 (or sphere) in directions, and they can use normal pilot personalities or 
 your keys.  The number of lines of code needed to do this correctly was surprisingly
 little! :-) glad I planned for this all along! </li>
                       
        <li> Vegastrike Beta is ready to release with sounds, music, and 
much more! </li>
                       
        <li> However, there's a catch... In order to release to the public 
 I need some original, free sounds... If you have some .wav's or .mp3's lying 
 around on your computer that match one of the following (they also need to
 be high quality, I don't want junk sounds...at leasr 22050) descriptions, 
 please send to me or contact me to arrange transportation if they're larger 
 than half a meg or so... </li>
                       
        <li> To release vegastrike I need at least 1 of each of the following 
 (send them to <a href="mailto:hellcatv@hotmail.com">hellcatv@hotmail.com</a>
   : </li>

        <li> missile firing sound </li>
                       
        <li> assorted weapon sounds </li>

        <li> cloaking sound </li>
                       
        <li> In addition vegastrike would be very happy to include any of
your personal music (released under any license you choose esp. GPL...open 
 source music whoohoo!) or other general uncopyrighted music for the final 
 release.  If you think you're a good composer and can write tunes, please 
 make some spacey themes. </li>
                       
        <li> Currently vegastrike will play tunes from the following 3 themes:
          </li>
                       
        <li> a) peace b) battle c) panic </li>
                       
        <li> if you have some music that isn't copyrighted that fits one 
of those bills, please send it to me. </li>

        <li> Vegastrike now has fully configurable sound and music! </li>
                       
        <li> The way music works is that you put a .m3u playlist in the 
data directory and it loads mp3's from it. Near the top means "I'm in trouble" 
 near the bottom means "I'm winning the battle! </li>
                       
        <li> Sounds are done completely in OpenAL 3D-sound, and it will 
be shortly hardware accelerated on Windows Creative Labs drivers! </li>
                       
        <li> expect a beta shortly (programmers can grab the cvs) </li>
                       
        <li> enjoy as lasers blast around you and starships explode on every
side of you, sending sound shockwaves flying through the (wait) vacuum of
space ;-) </li>
                       
        <li> Note: I do not have very good sound effects for laser blasts 
 and explosions. If you have some nice sounds (noncopyrighted please) then 
 please get in contact with me so we can arrange a file transfer and I can 
 include good sounds in the beta! Contact me at hellcatv@hotmail.com Thanks!

        <li> Radar is now configurable on certain ships to have color/black 
 and white, different ranges, itts, etc </li>
                       
        <li> I would send a sound screenshot, but it wouldn't really be...visible, 
 would it ;-) </li>
                       
        <li> Alexander Rawass has made a completely configurable configuration

 Go Alex! </li>

        <li> Vegastrike is now completely Geometry bound... So I spent a
lot of time perfecting an intricate system of LOD's that will not impact speed
at all. </li>
                       
        <li> However now that I can select LODs, I do not have ANY LODs 
to work with, so Vegastrike is still geometry bound. This is a plea to ALL 
 artists that have 3d modellers.  I need to convert a number of models for 
 the beta release.  I have placed the models at <a href="http://reflection.dyn.dhs.org/3ds/vsorig/">
   here</a>
    in .obj format.  I beg anyone that has a 3d modeller that can do Level
 of details to make me about 4 or 5 simplifications of hte given meshes.
 They don't need to look so great since they will be in the distance and
only a few pixels wide.  Anyone who helps me with just a few of their favorite
ships and sends conversions to <a href="mailto:hellcatv@hotmail.com">me</a>

 radar has all the ships, missile lights flicker... It's a sight to be <a href="pics/cockpit-screenshot.jpg">
    Seen!!!</a>

KPS readouts, etc! </li>
                       
        <li> Also the speed of vegastrike has been improved about 200% on
certain hardware systems!  Physics has been divided up into 3 stages that 
 each execute in sequence every .3333 seconds (instead of every .1 seconds 
 all three stages execute. </li>
                       
        <li> collision table speed has been much improved, and 2 offending 
 simple but time consuming functions have been optimized!!  This leaves no 
 functions as the single time killers!  Speed gains have been shown to be 
at least 180%! </li>
                       
        <li> Joystick support is being worked on by a new developer, Alexander 
 Rawass! He has figured out the code in no time flat!!! And is currently adding
 support! Go Alex! </li>

the beta release the number you specify will be the corresponding faction 
(from pirate to merchant to kilrathi) instead of the target. </li>

        <li> The AI "personality" engine is now complete.  You can control 
 a number of things about the enemy AI as in when it breaks off, when it goes
 full speed at you, when it afterburner slides around you.  This is all customizable
 within a text file, which will soon give each individual pilot his own personality!
           </li>
                       
        <li> A number of AI scripts have been programmed including shelton

 a rare, but successful kill! </li>
                       
        <li> Shield meshes may be separate from hull meshes... meaning once
the shield is down the artist has the option to have a separate hull BSP
tree (so skin-tight shields have an advantage) </li>

 format...check the readme for details when it is released. </li>

of days. </li>
                       
        <li> Yes this means fighting backguys and spectacular blood splitting, 
 ear curdling explosions... well not ear yet, but I have begin very basic 
preliminaries to make MP3's the choice sound format for vegastrike! </li>

        <li> This is a major milestone release! Not only do starships bounce 
 off each other when hitting each other, but close-in collisions work using 
 BSP trees (a bonus to prophecy, I made a bsp generator that generates prophecy 
 bsp trees) </li>
                       
        <li> In addition, a revolutionary shielding system has been devised 
 using OpenGL lights (completely accelerated on GeForce and ATI Radeon cards).
            </li>
                       
        <li> Shields can be hit in multiple directions by the beams, and 
they flicker appropriately! </li>
                       
        <li> And as a bonus to you realists, the saturn ring has been added 
 to the solar system to make it seem more...complete! </li>
                       
        <li> So fire up vegastrike, turn 90 degrees left, and start blasting 
 at the line of hornets. </li>
                       
        <li> don't crash into them or the planets or you might go careening 
 off into space!  </li>

        <li> Shield <a href="pics/shieldshot.jpg">proof-of-concept </a>
    is complete.  Now when I fire, the shield lights up... I still have to
 make it animate nicely...which should be doable but slightly tricky due
to  variable mesh sizes, etc. </li>
                       
        <li> I'm using OpenGL lights for shields, meaning that the lights 
 themselves around the shield light it up for damage. </li>
                       
        <li> each shot that hits factors into the creation of possibly new
lights to light up the shield in certain places (where in other cases it
would be completely transparent).  </li>
                       
        <li> this method of doing shields doesn't suffer from the problem 
 of large ships getting hit in many places (just put lights on both sides) 
 nor the problem of having to change and redownload the mesh each time part 
 of the shield is hit (to change the way it looks).  It just uses weak lights 
 that fade to make the shield <a href="pics/shieldshot2.jpg">shine</a>
   . </li>
                       
        <li> Expect the shields to look magnificent in the next release, 
which I anticipate fairly shortly. </li>

be (by only updating the table when a ship left or entered a sector of a system)
 </li>
                       
        <li> added bouncing feature so you bounce off stuff </li>

           </li>
                       
        <li> working on a unified lighting scheme that should be about 5-10
times faster than the previous system. </li>

        <li> BSP trees now work perfectly for both line and starship collisions.
            </li>
                       
        <li> this means that, unlike vegastrike classic, you'll be able 
to fly close to the hull of a large starship, hug the deck, fly through the
 launch bay... </li>
                       
        <li> Any closed model (eg Midway) can only be hit by a well placed 
 beam (no hitting if you fire between the legs of those Midway pants) </li>
                       
        <li> This also will make way for skin-tight shield effects on those 
 large ships! </li>
                       
        <li> an optimized BSP tree generator is available that can generate 
 trees for Vegastrike and even for prophecy.   </li>
                       
        <li> this generator can minimize the size of the tree or the time 
 it takes to search through it, using ideas inspired from the crystal space 
 engine (http://crystal.sourceforge.net) </li>
                       
        <li> if anyone has any ideas how to enforce the closed-ness of a
model, please let me know.  Currently many of the vegastrike classic models 
 are "open" and have gaps in them that allow you to collide, mid-space! (bad 
 things) </li>

        <li> AI is almost complete.  Currently I have a scripting ability 
 that lets you: </li>
                       
        <li> Execute any command for x seconds, Turn towards something (an
object or a location in space), Match speeds with something, Move to a location,
Orbit a location, and Combine movement and turning for a specified ammt of
time. </li>
                       
        <li> This enables us to do afterburner slide for instance!  Face 
90 degrees off enemy path while engaging afterburners to that direction; then
turn to target for x seconds. </li>
                       
        <li> Additionally the space of the arena was increased ten thousand-fold 
 from the lame 100 meters.  Now ships can be truly far off until they shrink 
 into specs of dust. </li>
                       
        <li> Orbiting of planets was fixed so they turn the correct way 
with respect to textures </li>
                       
        <li> Star systems may now have asteroids, multiple suns, and space 
 stations! Thanks to Patrick! </li>
                       
        <li> Collision was fixed to be fast for large objects greater than

big)           </li>
                       
        <li> Units can now orbit planets (asteroids, space stations, etc)

        <li> code has been started to split the world into factions. </li>
                       
        <li> Thomas Bruckner has aided us with a wonderful ship converter 
 from .pof format. </li>
                       
        <li> He's thinking of making the prophecy ship editor work with 
vegastrike! What a treat that would be! </li>

        <li> This release also shows the glowing engines... they will soon 
 dim as you lower the throttle, but right now they're just decorations, and 
 don't yet emit light either :-) </li>
                       
        <li> AI has had a major breakthrough yesterday--it can finally direct
its fire at stuff--- so very efficient enemies will be created soon!  So
the sun will not be the only enemy for very long! Look forward to a very skilled
AI! Coming soon.... </li>
                       
        <li> Vegastrike is coming to fruition! Check out the latest release, 
 and if you want to change the information about lasers (such as speed, range 
 and radius) you might wish to edit the weapon_list.xml  </li>
                       
        <li> Add your own weapons and put them on the hornet.xunit :-)  both
open in notepad! </li>

 and watch the weapon hit it. </li>
                       
        <li> note to windows users: printed messages to the console may 
slow down vegastrike. It will run faster if you minimize the dos box while 
 playing. </li>
