Thank you for considering donating to Vega Strike.  
<br>As you know, your time and energy helping design Vega Strike is far more essential to its continuation than money; however, I understand that time is a rare commodity and that people who are unable to contribute with their time still wish to aid Vega Strike as a whole.
<br>It is in this vein that I have created the donation button.  Your money will go to my little brother, Patrick and me, Daniel, to further our education.
<br>Patrick is twelve years old and has contributed at least 4000 lines of C++ code to Vega Strike along with countless missions and data files.  You can visit his own project here at <a href="http://virtuanet.sourceforge.net">http://virtuanet.sourceforge.net</a>.
<br>I am almost 21 and am going to the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm a member of the Eta Kappa Nu student group (<a href="http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu">http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu</a>) and have been enjoying my enriching education at Berkeley.<br><br>

Feel free to give any amount of money you choose. <br>
