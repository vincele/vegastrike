<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>There's more to Vegastrike than just space - Vegastrike is a space flight
sim with a terrain rendering engine included.
<p>To see the terrain mode in Vegastrike, you should best play the mission
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth_patrol1
<p>or an exporation mission that starts in Sol - or fly to Sol to see it
there.
<p>See those screenshots:
<p>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<a href="terrain1.jpg"><img SRC="terrain1s.png" NOSAVE height=150 width=200></a>
:&nbsp;<a href="terrain2.jpg"><img SRC="terrain2s.png" NOSAVE height=150 width=200></a>
:&nbsp;<a href="terrain3.jpg"><img SRC="terrain3s.png" NOSAVE height=150 width=200></a>
:&nbsp;<a href="terrain5.jpg"><img SRC="terrain5s.png" NOSAVE height=150 width=200></a>
<p>The first one was taken immediately after the start of the 'eart_patrol1'
mission, when you've rotated to face earth.
<p>Then you have to accelerate (use the afterburners) and dive down on
the planet.
<p>It won't take long and then you'll reach the clouds layer of the earth
- in screenshot 2, you're just about the fly through the clouds layer.
<p>Now fly even deeper and deeper, until you think you are crashing into
the earth itself - and that's the moment when the terrain will show up
like screenshot 3.
<p>You can fly low above the terrain - take your time, fly once around
the earth over the terrain - that takes some while, the earth is big -
and experience the sun going up over the terrain, see the lighning change
from darkness to light (screenshot 4)
<p>If you fly up again, the terrain will vanish and the blue-green earth
sphere will be there again.
<p>The hardware requirements to be able to see the terrain are harder than
for the rest of Vegastrike.
<br>You'll need at least 128MB RAM and 128MB swap - 256MB RAM might be
better.
<p>At present, the terrain is not quite usuable - except as a graphics
demonstration and for your enjoyment.
<br>The AIs can't yet fly properly about terrain, and we don't have buildings
or planes or helicopters or tanks yet - in code as well as graphics/models.
<p>If you'd like to help us here - by creating 3D models of such vehicles,
or by programming new vehicle units and vehicle AIs, we would appreciate
- please contact us :-)
<p>Some time, there should be a proper fly-low-over-surface mode with buildings,
trees, tanks, cars, planes, helis etc, so that we can also play 'Heli-Sim'
or 'Tank-Commander' in Vegastrike :-)
