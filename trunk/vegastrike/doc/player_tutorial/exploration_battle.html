Vegastrike Player Tutorial - Explorations, Skirmish and Battle&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size=+0><a href="index.html">to Index</a></font></h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>There are three different types of modes or ways to play Vegastrike:
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Exploration</h3>
Your task is it to fly around through the universe, using jump points to
jump from system to system and using time compression to able to cross
the distance between the jump points.
<p>You can explore new star systems, enjoy the look&amp;feel, fly from
planet to planet
<p>You should explore the occasional asteroid field - sometimes, there's
a jumpoint or a secret hidden in the middle of the asteroid field.
<p>Enemy and friendly ships will jump in from time to time while you're
exploring - you can try to leave them alone, but some enemies won't let
you.
<p>To play a exploration-style mission, use any of the missions that are
named
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explore_universe*
<p>When you quit an exploration mission with ESC, the system you're in
and your position will be saved into your home dir at ~/.vegastrike/save
<p>When you start the exploration mission again, you will resume flight
in the system/at the position you quitted.
<p>When you die, the game isn't saved.
<p>TODO: DanielH, you could talk here more about exploration and the different
missions and what you actually have to do in your exploration missions?
<p>TODO: maybe you could try to explain here how the missions YOU want
to have in exploration mode should work and behave - as opposed to my battle
missions?
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Skirmish</h3>
Skirmish missions are simple &amp; easy battle missions.
<p>The skirmish missions have no scripting, just fighers/cruisers/stations
in space that start fighting each other.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Battle</h3>
Battle mission are specially programmed missions where your task is it
to fight the enemies and improve your space-superiority fighting skills.
<p>In a battle mission you usually have to peform a special task - like
escorting a fleet to their jumppoint, defending you station against enemies
or a bombing run on an enemy cruiser.
<p>Currently, all missions that aren't named explore_universe* are battle
missions.
<p>When playing a battle mission, have a close look on your message display.
<br>There you'll see when new ships are launched.
<br>And there will be messages from your space command and other radio
messages to read.
<p>The battle missions should use - for now - less 'graphics' as the exploration
missions.
<p>The usual battle mission should only have one or two planets (fixed
to their positions, they shouldn't move) and some moons.
<br>That way, battle missions should work fine for users with less ram/gfx
speed than others.
<br>Later, we might write high-graphics versions of my battle missions.
<p>A Battle mission is played in rather a small part of the universe -
or rather more, in just a small part of a solar system.
<br>You won't need to fly far or use a lot of time compression in battle
missions.
<br>A battle mission runs only for 10-30 minutes, programmed things happen
at a certain time/certain events.
<br>At some point, the battle mission is over - either won, or lost, or
something in-between.
<p>If you've won/survived, Vegastrike will re-start with a new mission
(the next mission - there might be several next missions, depending how
good you've won).
<p>If you've lost/died, you will be able to re-fly that mission again -
and try better next time!
