Vegastrike Player Tutorial - Explorations and Battle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>There are two different types of modes or ways to play Vegastrike:
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Exploration</h3>
Your task is it to fly around through the universe, using jump points to
jump from system to system and using time compression to able to cross
the distance between the jump points.
<p>You can explore new star systems, enjoy the look&amp;feel, fly from
planet to planet
<p>You should explore the occasional asteroid field - sometimes, there's
a jumpoint or a secret hidden in the middle of the asteroid field.
<p>Enemy and friendly ships will jump in from time to time while you're
exploring - you can try to leave them alone, but some enemies won't let
you.
<p>To play a exploration-style mission, use any of the missions that are
named
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explore_universe*
<p>When you quit an exploration mission with ESC, the system you're in
and your position will be saved into your home dir at ~/.vegastrike/save
<p>When you start the exploration mission again, you will resume flight
in the system/at the position you quitted.
<p>When you die, the game isn't saved.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Battle</h3>
Battle mission are specially programmed missions where your task is it
to fight the enemies and improve your space-superiority fighting skills.
<p>In a battle mission you usually have to peform a special task - like
escorting a fleet to their jumppoint, defending you station against enemies
or a bombing run on an enemy cruiser.
<p>Currently, all missions that aren't named explore_universe* are battle
missions.
<p>When playing a battle mission, have a close look on your message display.
<br>There you'll see when new ships are launched.
<br>And there will be messages from your space command and other radio
messages to read.
