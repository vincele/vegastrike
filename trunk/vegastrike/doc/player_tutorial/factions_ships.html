Vegastrike Player Tutorial - Factions and Ship Types&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<font size=+0><a href="index.html">to

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>In the Vegastrike universe, the following factions exist:
<ul>
<li>
neutral</li>

<br>neutral ships are neutral to any other faction
<li>
confed</li>

<br>the 'good guys' - the earthlings
<br>confed is at war with the aera
<br>confed is slightly suspicious about rlaan ships
<li>
aera</li>

<br>the 'bad boys' - the bad alien race with evil in their mind
<br>they are at war with anyone
<li>
rlaan</li>

<br>some other unknown alien race?
<br>at least, they're in war with the aera, too - but they wouldn't mind
a small fight with confed fighters
<li>
unknown</li>

<br>well, they're unknown, what can I say?
<br>just blow'em away, cause they don't like anyone
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
If you are curious, have a look at the file data/factions.xml - you'll
find the factions definitions there.
<p>TODO: explain more about the different factions - what the heck are
aera and rlaan, and what's the story about the confed etc?
<br>TODO:there should be a bit of story here??

I would really like it if any of the creators of these ships would tell
me more about them.
<p>TODO: explain what the different ships are - in words - if they're small/medium/large
bombers/fighers/recoinaissance/whatever etc
<br>TODO:explain in words if they are fast or slow, turn well or not, and
something about a story etc
<br>TODO:I can also write a function that saves the necessary ship info
as a html-table
<br>TODO:but you're already working on saving units, maybe that can be
done in one?
<br>TODO:but please explain also in WORDS, not in numbers, what these ships
are?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This ship type information was taken from the scripting file data/modules/faction_ships.c
