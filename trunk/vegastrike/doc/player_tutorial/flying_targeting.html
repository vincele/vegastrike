<h3>
Flying:</h3>
Currently, you can steer your ship via keyboard or joystick - joystick
is of course recommended.
<p>You can use the following keys to steer:
<ul>
<li>
cursor arrow keys (or joystick)</li>

<br>banks your starship up,down,left or right
<li>
insert and delete</li>

<br>rotates your ship around it's forward axis
<li>
TAB</li>

<br>fire the afterburner
<br>you have to keep TAB presses to use the afterburner
<li>
+ and -</li>

<br>increase or decrease speed
<li>
backspace</li>

<br>full stop
<li>
y</li>

<br>matches the speed of the targeted ship
<li>
` or capslock</li>

<br>shelton key - you can do the shelton slide with it</ul>
Use + and - to increase/decrease your speed while flying around
<p>But if you really wanna go fast, press TAB to put in the afterburners
to get near to an enemy fighter
<p>If you press y then, your speed will be matched with the targets speed,
and you can easily fire on it
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Targeting:</h2>
You can fire (and hit) on any target you want - even if you're not targeting
the ship you're firing at.
<p>But it is advised that you target the ship you want to fire on.
<p>The targeted ship will be highlighted and it's blip on the radar will
appear bigger, so you'll always know here your target is.
<p>Use those keys to target differently:
<ul>
<li>
t - cycle Targets</li>

<br>press t to cycle between targets
<br>all possible targets (enemies, friends, planets, jumppoints, stations
etc) are cycled
<li>
p - Pick Target</li>

<br>selects the target that is currently the nearest to your crosshairs
<br>If you want to pick a special target, steer your ship until the crosshair
is on it, and then press p
<li>
n - nearest Target</li>

<br>selects the nearest target for you
<li>
h - select Threat</li>

<br>select the enemy target that is most threatening to you</ul>
