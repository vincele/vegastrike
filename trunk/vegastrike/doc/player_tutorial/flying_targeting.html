<h3>
<a NAME="flying"></a>Flying:</h3>
Currently, you can steer your ship via keyboard or joystick - joystick
is of course recommended.
<p>You can use the following keys to steer:
<ul>
<li>
cursor arrow keys (or joystick)</li>

<br>banks your starship up,down,left or right
<li>
insert and delete</li>

<br>rotates your ship around it's forward axis
<li>
TAB</li>

<br>fire the afterburner
<br>you have to keep TAB presses to use the afterburner
<li>
+ and -</li>

<br>increase or decrease speed
<li>
backspace</li>

<br>full stop
<li>
y</li>

<br>matches the speed of the targeted ship
<li>
` or capslock</li>

<br>shelton key - you can do the shelton slide with it
<li>
A</li>

<br>autopilot: flies your ship to your target (usually a base or station
or jumppoint)</ul>
Use + and - to increase/decrease your speed while flying around
<p>But if you really wanna go fast, press TAB to put in the afterburners
to get near to an enemy fighter
<p>If you press y then, your speed will be matched with the targets speed,
and you can easily fire on it
<p>TODO: explain that shelton slide thing
<br>TODO:explain when you should use afterburner or +/- explain about the
fuel use etc
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Newtonian Physics:</h4>
Vegastrike usel real, newtonian physics and forces to calculate where the
space ships are flying too.
<p>This means, that when your ship has built up a certain velocity, it
will continue to fly in this direction even when you rotate/bank the ship
around.
<br>To fly in a new direction, you have to accellerate the ship into that
direction.
<p>TODO:Can anyone explain that better?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="targeting"></a>Targeting:</h2>
You can fire (and hit) on any target you want - even if you're not targeting
the ship you're firing at.
<p>But it is advised that you target the ship you want to fire on.
<p>The targeted ship will be highlighted and it's blip on the radar will
appear bigger, so you'll always know here your target is.
<br>A rectangular target box will appear round the target.
<br>This target box will have the same color as the blip on the radar -
green for friends, red for enemies, yellow for neutral ships
<p>If you want that all units in space should have a box rendered around
them - so that you can see them better - you have to <a href="editing_vegaconfig.html">edit
vegastrike.config</a>:
<ul>
<li>
section "graphics", subsection "hud", variable "drawAllTargetBoxes"</li>

<li>
set this <a href="editing_vegaconfig.html#variables">variable</a> to "true"
to have boxes on all units</li>

<li>
in this mode, friends will be green, enemies red, neutral ships yellow
and your target will be purple</li>
</ul>
<img SRC="all_target_boxes.png" NOSAVE height=154 width=197> :&nbsp;<img SRC="all_target_boxes_false.png" NOSAVE height=143 width=205>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The left shows a screenshot with drawAllTargetBoxes=true</li>

<br>you can easily identity your current target (purple) and who's friend
and who's hostile
<li>
the right screenshot was taken with drawAllTargetBoxes=false</li>

<br>your targeted ship has a red box - it's hostile</ul>
Use those keys to target differently:
<ul>
<li>
t - cycle Targets</li>

<br>press t to cycle between targets
<br>all possible targets (enemies, friends, planets, jumppoints, stations
etc) are cycled
<li>
p - Pick Target</li>

<br>selects the target that is currently the nearest to your crosshairs
<br>If you want to pick a special target, steer your ship until the crosshair
is on it, and then press p
<li>
n - nearest Target</li>

<br>selects the nearest target for you
<li>
h - select Threat</li>

<br>select the enemy target that is most threatening to you
<br>TODO: write what is the 'greatest threat'</ul>

<p><br>Please note that the targeting range is limited - that means, you
can't target ships which are more than about 10.000 away.
<br>The targeting range depends on the ship type that you're using.
<br>TODO: is that correct? are there other limits?
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
ITTS</h4>
ITTS means ......&nbsp;<img SRC="itts1.png" NOSAVE height=144 width=153 align=ABSCENTER>
<p>TODO: what means ITTS in full?
<p>Some ships have got an ITTS display to help you in aiming at your target.
<p>The above screenshots shows two rectangles - the left, smaller one is
the ITTS indicator, the big to the right is the target box that is drawn
around your target.
<p>The ITTS calculates the point in space where you have to aim/fire at
to hit your target, when it keeps flying with that speed and direction.
<p>So, you should always aim at your ITTS, if your ship has one.
<p>TODO:explain ITTS better.
<p>If you want every ship you fly to have an ITTS, then you have to <a href="editing_vegaconfig.html">edit
your vegastrike.config</a>:
<ul>
<li>
section "graphics", subsection "hud", variable "drawAlwaysITTS"</li>

<li>
set this <a href="editing_vegaconfig.html#variables">variable</a> to "true"
and the ITTS will always show up.</li>
</ul>
