<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The vssetup tool can be used to configure Vegastrike for your preferences.
<p>Start it by going to the data dir and type:&nbsp; ./vssetup
<p>TODO: Sabarok - any cmd line options or else here?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="vssetup1.png" NOSAVE height=262 width=392>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Above you can see a screenshot of vssetup.
<p>You can configure it - at the moment - in 5 categories:
<ul>
<li>
Computer</li>

<li>
Video</li>

<li>
Sound</li>

<li>
Difficulty</li>

<li>
Experiment</li>
</ul>
The selected settings are shown in a [ Bracket ]
<p>When you think, your selection matches your need/your computer, press
'Done'
<p><b>Experimental Options For Speed Improvement</b>
<p>If you wish to ensure vegastrike has no geometry corruption you may select stable as your experimental option.  Unfortunately this resuts in lower framerates than otherwise possible.  Certain options have been tested under linux to make things faster but segfault (against the spec) in windows. These options are labelled linux_safe because they have been tested in linux and are believed to be safe. If you experience geometry corruption or random crashing, which we have not, in linux with these options please report.
<p> Likewise Windows people may select windows_safe options for framerate improvements.  These options have been known to fail with GeForce3 under linux, but are untested otherwise. Windows_safe options are not known to crash under any circumstances.
<p> linux_safe has been proven to be faster but causes privaledged instruction errors under Windows2000 on occasion.  Feel free to try it out on your own machien and tell us what works
<br>
<p><b>Difficulties</b>
<p> Difficulties affect the distance one must be from an enemy in order to engage time compression.  For easy difficulty autopilot can be used almost always.  Also the speed with which the planets turn and orbit teh sun is extremely slow in easy mode so you do not have to plan your trajectory to get to a jump point.  Afterburner fuel usage is much lower in easy, and much higher in hard.  When fuel runs out in easy or medium, you merely lose some of hte potency of your afterburners.  In hard you lose most of your thrusting capability.  Lastly asteroids become much harder as difficulty increases.
<p>TODO: Sabarok - explain more if you like
<p>If you want to have your settings more refined, you have to <a href="editing_vegaconfig.html">edit
your vegastrike.config</a> file per hand.
