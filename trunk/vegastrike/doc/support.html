    You have obviously been having some troubles with installing or playing 
 Vegastrike...otherwise you would not be here!  Before you come to us, make 
 sure you have read the documentation properly.  If your problem is undocumented 
 (as is likely to be the case) then send your cries for help to          
         <a href="mailto:vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net">vegastrike-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
   and we will endevour to respond as quickly and helpfully as possible.<br>
        <br>
  If your problem is technical --as in big confusing error messages-- then
 please make sure that you include technical information.  We will want to
 know the exact error message as well as some information about your system.
  (The files: stderr.txt and stdout.txt from the data directory would be
great,  or you can just copy and paste the error into the email).<br>
        <br>
  ie  if the problem appears to be graphical, tell us your OS (windows/linux),
 video card, and the error messages.<br>
        <br>
  If you honestly have no idea what the problem may be, then send us information
 on everything --it is better to have too much info than too little.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
If you would like to help out project, you can always simply document you
experience and maybe we can start a FAQ page to help others in need ;-).<br>
