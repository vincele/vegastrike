<h2>
Starting Vegastrike:</h2>
to start Vegastrike, you have to cd to the data directory and then start
the Mission Selector:
<p>./vsselect
<p>A dialog will pop up, you can select a mission from the list, and then
click 'run mission'
<p>Or start Vegastrike from shell:
<p>./vegastrike [-j&lt;system-name>] &lt;mission-file>
<p>Mission file has to be a file from the ./mission directory
<br>System name is an optional system name to use instead of the missions
default system
<p>Examples:&nbsp; ./vegastrike mission/earth_patrol1.mission
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
./vegastrike mission/ships_confed1.mission
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
./vegastrike mission/test/test4.mission
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
./vegastrike -jsol_sector/Sol mission/explore_universe_neutral.mission
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Configuring Vegastrike:</h2>
Before first start, you should use vssetup to configure Vegastrike for
your needs - cpu speed, graphics card etc
<p>Start vssetup from the data dir with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./vssetup
<p>A dialog will pop up where you can select
<ul>
<li>
your cpu speed,</li>

<li>
your type of gfx card</li>

<li>
your sound preferences</li>

<li>
game difficulty</li>

<li>
experimental settings</li>
</ul>
Select the buttons which match your computer/your preferences best and
click 'done'.
<p>You can the start Vegastrike and see if you like the settings, if not,
you can start vssetup again and choose different settings.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Vegastrike can also be configured by editing the file 'vegastrike.config'
file in the data directory.
<p>Editing the 'vegastrike.config' by hand gives you more granularity in
your choices than using vssetup.
<p>You can configure Key- and Joystickbindings there, and adjust Vegastrike's
config variables to match your computers speed.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Playing Vegastrike:</h2>
When the game starts, you should be sitting in a cockpit of a space fighter.
<p>Press F1 to switch from cockpit view to HUD view and back.
<p>Use the cursor keys or Joystick to steer your ship.
<p>Use Space Bar or the first Joy-Button to fire your lasers.
<p>Press 't' to target a different ship.
<p>Hold down TAB to accellerate your ship with afterburners.
<p>Press F5/F6 to see your ship from behind.
<p>Press ESC to quit.
<p>For more keys, have a look at the vegastrike.config file
<p>On your radar, you can see enemy and friendly ships.
<br>Enemies are red dots, friends are green.

<h2>
Playable Missions :</h2>
Currently, Vegastrike can be played in two different ways:
<ul>
<li>
play any of the missions named 'explore_universe' or alike</li>

<br>These missions lets you play in a big, random generated universe
<br>Your task is it to fly through the system, explore and enjoy it, fight
random enemies or help friends defend themselves
<br>You can fly through jumppoints to other systems and explore them, too
<li>
play a 'battle mission'</li>

<br>in a battle mission, you have a certain setting in a special system,
where you have to battle incoming enemies or defend your installations
<br>the main task is to survive...</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;</ul>
Overview of the 'battle' missions in data/mission (valid for vegastrike-0.2.0):
<p>&nbsp;recommended:
<blockquote>
<li>
earth_patrol_rnd_attack1</li>

<br>fly around the earth and get attacked by aera enemies, which appear
around your area
<br>can you survive without help
<li>
earth_patrol_rnd_attack2</li>

<br>like above, but confed help will jump in from time to time to save
your ass
<li>
total_war1</li>

<br>war in space - wave after wave of confed/aera gets launched
<br>luckily, you steer a neutral ship :-)
<li>
total_war2</li>

<br>as above - but you're confed now (and get attacked)
<li>
bomber</li>

<br>fly a bombing run onto some cruisers
<li>
drone_duel</li>

<br>you have to battle an alien drone, but your weapons are ineffective
<br>you have to first find a secret hidden in an asteroid field...
<li>
nebula_tag</li>

<br>fight the computer AI in a nebula - your radar won't work in the nebula
<li>
proving_grounds, proving_grounds_simple</li>

<br>you have to fight computer AIs and collect powerups
<li>
tag, tag2</li>

<br>there are many jumppoints in this mission
<br>use them wisely to gain advantage over your enemies</blockquote>
still in development:
<ul>
<li>
earth_patrol1</li>

<br>lets you fly around the earth and experience the terrain
<br>just fly straight to and into earth, try to crash your ship into the
earth globe - and then you'll see the terrain
<li>
earth_defender1</li>

<br>defend earth from the bad aera
<li>
earth_defend_cruiser1,earth_defend_cruiser2</li>

<br>defend a cruiser in earth range from the aera attack

<br>sort-of a stresstest - really lots of ships get launched very fast
<li>
ships_aera2,ships_aera3</li>

<br>see the aera ships rotating in space (to have a look at them)
<li>
ships_confed1,ships_confed2</li>

<br>as above, just with the confed ships
<li>
station_defend1,station_defend2</li>

<br>defend a space station from the aera
<li>
asteroid_field1</li>

<br>fight enemies inside and around an asteroid field
<li>

<br>a basic tutorial on flying, still in development</ul>

<blockquote>
<li>
The missions in the data/mission folder should be playable.</li>

<li>
mission/test contains test missions and</li>

<br>mission/testd contains test missions for the new director
<br>those might work or not</blockquote>
