2001-10-29 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* ported to windows (sound et all)
	* added Direct3DSound support for windoze hardware acceleration
	* added doppler effect (off by default) to config & aldrv lib
	* modified aldrv to use a limited number of sources
	* fixed sound "stealing" so that it respected the limited sources
	* changed weapons to play with looping sounds to eliminate static
	* modified weapon sounds to 'steal' properly so human gets to hear his sounds
	* modified camera to have 1/2 frame lagtime in figuring out which ships to clip
	* modified music to respect limited number of sources.
	* modified music to respect doppler effect & position
	* modified music to allow <4 length playlists
	* modified Units to have a configurable ModelDetail value (higher means that higher (better) LODs are used for far starships

2001-10-27 Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net>

	* added section printout when warning for variables

2001-10-25 Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* fixed bug in joystick routines that caused it to fly wildly around
	   on win32 when having no joystick


2001-10-25 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>
	* added ability to delete playing sounds
	* added ability to have explosions without alpha (GL_ONE,GL_ONE)
	* changed GFXPickLights's checking if object was too large to work with to use floats so it won't over flow
	* fixed GFXPickLights () to actually work! (now lights are picked out of a 3d hash table)
	* added the option to put star system lights into the 3d hash table light="0 1l"  means 0 is on globally and 1 is on for starships "near enough" Now we only have 1 global light and 1 attenuated light for starships "close enough" Framerates should skyrocket for GeForce cards
	* learned not to debug with fastmath on
	* added default states for cockpits
	* added default space background color if backgrounds should be off
	* modified test.xml to make planets farther apart
	* modified config_xml.cpp to print out the missing var's default val
	
2001-10-25 Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* implemented orders in mission file (preliminary)

2001-10-25 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>
	* added starsystem based lighting (now planets may emit lights
	* define a light at the top of a system then any planets may use such a light. 
	* data directory changed so that starships get hot (glow) when they get close to the sun.  Ambient light index increased for dinged up monitors (you can edit it yourself... 


2001-10-24 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Turrets to the scenes.  They may use any preconcieved AI script, but right now they just load "turntowards" and "fireat" target
	* made an ifdef to allow the user to fly a turret  #ifdef IPILOTTURRET
	* IFLYTURRET will only work if the unit in question has a turret
	* add turrets as follows:  	<Subunit file="rapier" y="10" ri="0" rj="1" rk="0" pi="0" pj="0" pk="1" restricted="-.5"/>
	* turrets may not use their own type for a turret...
	* retricted means dot with "Ri,Rj,Rk" vector must be greater than that value  (so turrets can't turn inside a hull)	


2001-10-24 Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net>

	* new command-line argument: vegastrike <mission-name>
	* removed old un-needed code (old key-bindings)

2001-10-22 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>
	* modified units to go in <data>/unit/<unitname> or <data>/unit/<factionname>/<unitname>
	* modified textures go either in the "current dir" or in <data>/textures/ for shared textures
	* modified sounds to either go in the current dir or <data>/sounds
	* modified animations to go in <currentdir>/animations
	* modified sprites to go in <currentdir>/sprites
	* allowed flat data directories too :-)

	* changed the number of times the sound's location was updated to once every physics phase
	* fixed  a problem with weapons (one that had been there for a while) that weapons would be fired by the AI script and not be aligned to a physics frame... this produced a somewhat cool but undesirable effect to have the weapons seem to carry with them a lot of inertia  so I made the unit remember when a shot was fired, and then instead "fire it" at the physics frame 
	* problem caused: because the physics frame deals with the "next" frame instead of this one....  so I had to use the saved data from the previous frame...which is somewhat inaccurate as I do not know the parent of this unit (may cause problems with a turret on a wildly evading starship)


2001-10-21 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Sound support
	* added buffers share preloaded sounds

2001-10-11 Alexander Rawass <alexannika@users.sourceforge.net>

	* made joystick work (no buttons yet, no hat, just steering)
	  - no FlyByWire::Execute(); is called in FlyByKeyboard::Execute()
