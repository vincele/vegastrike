2001-10-24 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Turrets to the scenes.  They may use any preconcieved AI script, but right now they just load "turntowards" and "fireat" target
	* made an ifdef to allow the user to fly a turret  #ifdef IPILOTTURRET
	* IFLYTURRET will only work if the unit in question has a turret
	* add turrets as follows:  	<Subunit file="rapier" y="10" ri="0" rj="1" rk="0" pi="0" pj="0" pk="1" restricted="-.5"/>
	* turrets may not use their own type for a turret...
	* retricted means dot with "Ri,Rj,Rk" vector must be greater than that value  (so turrets can't turn inside a hull)

	* modified sounds to either go in the current dir or <data>/sounds
	* modified animations to go in <currentdir>/animations
	* modified sprites to go in <currentdir>/sprites
	* allowed flat data directories too :-)

	* changed the number of times the sound's location was updated to once every physics phase
	* fixed  a problem with weapons (one that had been there for a while) that weapons would be fired by the AI script and not be aligned to a physics frame... this produced a somewhat cool but undesirable effect to have the weapons seem to carry with them a lot of inertia  so I made the unit remember when a shot was fired, and then instead "fire it" at the physics frame 
	* problem caused: because the physics frame deals with the "next" frame instead of this one....  so I had to use the saved data from the previous frame...which is somewhat inaccurate as I do not know the parent of this unit (may cause problems with a turret on a wildly evading starship)


2001-10-21 Daniel Horn <hellcatv@hotmail.com>

	* added Sound support
	* added buffers share preloaded sounds
