*** GENERAL ************************************************************

- Consider handle damages to docked ships if they can be hit
- Use and "hand-shake" protocol between server and client
- Interpolate orientation too ? (3 interpolations)
- CUBIC SPLINES : interpolate time linearly with SPLINE_METHOD2
DONE ? Carsten - Compress sent data in Packet (_packetmem member)

*** ACCOUNT SERVER *****************************************************

- Compress the save files before sending them to game server


*** GAME SERVER ********************************************************

- Put back a control with keyboard to be able to SAVE, SEE MEMORY USED...
- Add the player faction to SaveGame
- Transmit data only for ships, missiles, bolt : send only direction ?
- When a request to jump -> check if the destination is reachable by origin system with UniverseUtil::GetAdjacentSystems()
- Think about transfering config data such as difficulty, physics...
- Find all the used vars in Unit stuff and integrate them in the serverconfig
- When another player is targeted, get his data (damage level, shield, weapons if we have the appropriate sensors)
  -> at least the name (got from unit name... to see)

TO TEST - try to reconnect to account server periodicaly if connection lost
TO LOOK AT - When receiving a packet : look at timestamp and compare it to latest receive timestamp for that client


*** CLIENT SIDE *********************************************************

- Find a way not to use MAXOBJECTS in netclient.h
- Interpolate(extrapolate) using delatime + the concerned client's current_state delay
OR
- Maybe send extrapolated position with deltatime ahead in time
- and when receiving position updates extrapolate only with concerned client's delay
DONE - When receiving position update, test if local player
DONE - When receiving a packet : look at timestamp and compare it to latest receive timestamp from the server
DONE - when one exits from VS -> send a quit msg
DONE - Use a NETWORK_ATOM to check if it's time to send position update


=== GENERAL STUFF =======================================================

DONE - split asteroids, enhancement, building, nebula into 2 classes
DANIEL DONE in endianness.cpp - add htond and htond for doubles : they are completely reversed
DONE - Remove the isPlayer function and related data

OBSOLETE - Maybe send the unit radius in some way to the server so he can approximate if we can see other clients
DONE - make first login packets more reliable and stopping the game when fails (use a loop)
DONE - create configxml.* to handle VS server's configuration file (TIMEOUT, number of clients...)
DONE - remove "SERIAL" from accountxml
DONE - think about sending a warning to the account server from the game server when a client is disconnected
DONE - Add a networked boolean in the Unit class with a SetNetworkMode() method to set networked=1
DONE - Problem on old_microtime (not initialized) when sending first packet
DONE - Send a delay var in Packet for client->server delay and then timestamp from server->clients
NO BECAUSE DEFAULT TO ZLIB - Put some negociation stage to check that client support zlib


=== ACCOUNT SERVER ======================================================

DONE - Then transfert unit description with login acceptance
DONE - Fix the bug when transmitting name for disconnection ??
DONE : made a StarSystem::Update() method for server - Move StarSystem::Loop to server side
DONE - Move to server side UpdatePhysics function from unit_physics.cpp
DONE - Turn Client::game_unit into a UnitContainer
DONE - Implement removeFromStarSystem ? and Destroy in Unit class
DONE - add a timeout test if !ingame with a second timeout much bigger

=== GAME SERVER =========================================================

DONE - when server savetime comes, send unit xml to account server for each client
  compressed? in a single packet with serials or names
DONE - Load StarSystems on demand (when a player enters an empty starsystem)
DONE - forsee account server unavailability and in that case, deny new logins + send msg to client

=== CLIENT SIDE =========================================================
